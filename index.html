    <p> My sister has been sick and stay home all day. She doesn't do anything at all.
    I help her to bring food to her room. Since the disease is highly infectous, the only thing
  she needs to do is stay inside her room and hug the computer <em>(literrally).</em> </p>

    <p>If somebody would have told me a week ago that I would be able to build
    a website. I wouldn't believe them.</p>
    <p>Just a few days later, I was sick from <a href="https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/canada">Covid-19</a>. I have been <em>staying home</em>
    for 2 weeks. Bored and have nothing to do, I searched up how to create a website</p>
